## The Curse of Strahd

In the fog-shrouded lands of Barovia, four strangers awake to lands unkown with no recollection of their arrival...

_Slim Darkness_ is the type of man to steal the pennies off your eyes. He's not dumb enough to stick his neck out for whomever he's 
walking with for that moment. He wakes up in the forest to the sight of a strange old man. _Sir Lysander Stanley Conrad_, a big-game hunter
who found himself in Barovia long ago, was happy to greet a new arrival. 

...

Chadman looked deep into its eyes as the creature took its last breaths. There was a moment of silence as a breeze fluttered through the leaves 
of the forest. Under the rustling of the leaves a softer sound could be heard... _Hoo... hooo..._ as if a child were calling for mother. 
Chadman, distraught by this crime against such a beautiful thread in the great tapestry of nature, knew that something had to be done. Diving
through the brush, he soon found the source of the sound, a young owl-bear now bereft of its mother. Chadman's heart was breaking, so he took
up the young one and wrapped it in a blanket while it nipped softly at his fingers. The other party members looked amongst each other. They knew 
that taking care of an animal, a wild one at that, could keep them from their duty of confronting Strahd. Lysander let a deep sigh escape him, 
and walked towards Chadman.

"Son, I know that you don't approve of what we've done here. But that child is safest on its own. Owl-bears are an apex preadator, and even
a child can easily fend for itself. What you need to do, in order to help the order of nature, is to let him go."

Chadman looked back at Lysander, then down again to the young one swaddled in his arms. A warm tear trickled from his eye, and he began to unwrap
the child. As he was putting it down, he said, "I'll never forget you. Stay safe out there Brad." The owl-bear took a few steps, looked back once
again, and then dashed deep into the woods.
